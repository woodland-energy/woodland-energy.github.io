            <h3>Attention! Attention!: To all HUBERT&reg; owners, an all points bulletin!</h3>

            <p>Immediately face your HUBERT&reg; solar electric generator to the south (to the north in the southern hemisphere). Let's make some changes! Let's start a worldwide movement. Let's all together face our HUBERTs&reg; the same way and spread our HUBERTs&reg; healing energy in the same direction! Together perhaps we can begin to create "One Peaceful Clean Earth". Thank you!</p>

            <p>"Let's practice the art of placement, or Feng Shui, or harmony, or balance, or complementary antagonism, or geomancy, or any one of many other names." It's a fascinating concept. Check it out! Anyways we should spread HUBERTs&reg; energy in the same direction. Together perhaps we can begin to create "One Peaceful Clean Earth".</p>

			<h3>About Us:</h3>

			<p>First some historical perspective regarding Woodland Energy&reg;.</p>

			<p>The following was written by Leonard Tingley, Federal Products Corp., Providence RI, Grandfather of Woodward Johnson, Founder of Woodland Energy&reg;.</p>

			<p><strong>Ode to Precision</strong><br />
			Oh, an Indicator is a vindicator<br />
			Of truth and common knowledge.<br />
			For it teaches more, and faster too,<br />
			Than an Engineering College.<br />
			How long is this? How short is that?<br />
			To what degree is this piece flat?<br />
			How thick is the paper in the pile?<br />
			Look for your answer on the dial.<br />
			For we've put jewels within the case,<br />
			And stamped our name across the face,<br />
			So you'll remember through the years,<br />
			That Federal always hobs their gears.<br />
			Our top and bottom place construction<br />
			Always has defied destruction,<br />
			And we speak of low friction,<br />
			As the utmost in perfection.<br />
			For, and Indicator is a vindicator<br />
			Of truth and common knowledge.<br />
			For it teaches more, and faster too,<br />
			Than an Engineering College.</p>

            <p>These instruments were used during the World War II to, amongst other things, measure the surface of ball bearings and spinning drive shafts. They were capable of measuring down to a millionth of an inch. This was a key factor in the manufacturing and efficiency of equipment made during the war. Today with the advent of computers it's done electronically and not mechanically. These instruments or "Micrometers" were also the beginning of the modern day compass and pocket watch. We recommend reading the fascinating book "Longitude" by Dava Sobel.</p>

            <br /><br />

			<p>Woodland Energy&reg; is a small company in Northern Massachusetts with big ideas. Living simply and close to the land, deriving energy from the source, it seeks to spread access to the essential powers of the planet such as the sun and the deepest parts of the universe.</p>
			<p>Our flagship product the HUBERT&reg;, acronym for Home Utilities and Boating Electrical Rechargeable Transporter, can provide you with simultaneous production of alternating current i.e. electricity from your wall and direct current i.e. electricity from a battery or HUBERT&reg;.</p>

			<p>Woodland Energy is the leader in energy saving technology. Check it out! Roll On. And underneath third picture on bottom. THE HELM Let's do it!</p>

      <p>HUBERT&reg; gets it's electrical current by extracting energy from the sun and storing in specialized sealed batteries for use any time you need it, for whatever you need it for. We personally inspect and test all of our solar generators before they are "out the door".</p>

			<p>Whether you need power at a job site, in the woods, or <strong>daily use</strong> in the office, in the city, or just for backup power, around the home, we have a unit to fit your electrical needs.</p>

			<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
			<p>To make electricity available anywhere that there is a need for it. Whether you need to recharge power tool batteries at a remote job site or maintain battery back up power for small appliances in your home during a power outage, we have a solution for you. If you live in an area where traditional fossil fueled generators are impractical or unsafe power can be just outside your sunny window or on a deck.</p>

			<p>Woodland Energy has donated four of its HUBERT&reg; - Solar Powered Generators, to the American Red Cross for use at disaster relief sites. One recently deployed to the American Red Cross in response to the relief efforts in Haiti.</p>

			<h3>History:</h3>
			<p>Incorporated in 1985 with the development of the first Hubert and tested through many years of living "Off of the Grid", this patented idea is the brainstorm of Woodward Johnson. Woody has been experimenting with alternative power sources for 40 years. Woody is still involved with developing new forms of energy generation.</p>

			<h3>Products</h3>

			<p>Solar Power Now! The choice is ours as to where we get our electricity from for the future. For our children's children's children and a long time to come. The future is wide open!</p>

			<p>All our Huberts&reg; generate 12 volts DC and/or 110 volts AC electricity from an internal battery bank. All of our Huberts&reg; are guaranteed to not smoke, have no exhaust and make very little noise, just a mild hum. Use them in your living room! Quietly! Recharge them with their attached adjustable solar panels or plug them into the wall.</p>

			<p>Run Time: volts x amps = watts</p>
			<p>Amps per hour: watts / volts</p>

			<p>1. Please note - don't forget the solar panels! They will increase the run time.<br />2. Please note - small battery powered rechargeable devices work well especially if you remove the rechargeable battery from the tool and set it aside in it's own 12 volt battery charger. You can then continue to use Hubert&reg; and let the battery recharge off of solar power with the main switch in the down position and the auxiliary switch in the up position. This will power up the 12 volt receptacle off solar power directly.</p>

			<p>

			<p>Devices that can operate with a 12 volt D.C. power cord work great, for instance laptops with car cords.</p>

			<p><strong>Option #1</strong>: Hubert&reg; with solar panels folder out to capture the sun's energy. $5,000.00 Scroll down to the picture of the Erica Wheeler Concert. Yes folks that's right it's the same hubert&reg;. It's getting around! Small World!</p>

			<p><img src="images/IMG_2843.jpg" alt="" /></p>

			<p><strong>Option #2</strong>: Solar panels on the end of Hubertville office with mobile Hubert&reg; inside. $5,500.00</p>

			<p><img src="images/IMG_2849.jpg" alt="" /></p>

			<p><strong>Option #3</strong>: Solar arrays at garage with Hubert&reg; and backup batteries inside. $8,000.00</p>

			<p><img src="images/IMG_2847.jpg" alt="" /></p>

			<p><strong>"Woodland Energy's Solar Array"</strong><br />A roof or array south of the equator would have to face north to collect the sun's energy. A roof or array north of the equator would have to face south to collect the sun's energy. Woodland Energy's array, like in this picture, is positioned correctly to recharge an electric vehicle.</p>

				<div id="laakso" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
					<p>In the year 2000 I graduated college and began working for the family business. One of my first jobs was
                    working at the Johnson’s home installing a new roof. As soon as the roof was complete a solar power
                    crew arrived to install a large set of photovoltaic panels. I was blown away. In the early 2000s I knew
                    nothing about solar power, however over the next few years I would become much more aware of the
                    free energy the sun could provide. Woodland Energy’s solar generator “HUBERT” was introduced to me
                    and I was able to use it for some small projects around the Johnson’s home. After I got over the “this
                    is cool” factor I stopped and realized what I had done that day. I had run a 10 amp circular saw all day
                    using no gasoline, hearing no engine noise, leaving no smog forming emissions. I now own a HUBERT
                    myself; it is used mostly to power woodworking tools in my small workshop and keep my cordless tools
                    charged. You will find however that the true value of this generator cannot be appreciated until you
                    find yourself without power. When we lose power at my home I do four things, 1. Run to the HUBERT.
                    2. Plug in my sump pump. 3. Plug in my TV. 4. Sit worry free. This generator is very useful to me and I
                    believe it to be useful to nearly anyone. You could look for a long time and not find a cooler product or
                    sweeter people than you find at Woodland Energy, for that I thank them.</p>

                    <p>Sincerely, Davin Laakso</p>

                    <p>Laakso Building Contractors.</p>
